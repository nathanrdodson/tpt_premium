== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the import format look like? =

"quantity:price,quantity:price"

For example:
"10:20,20:18" - in this case 20.00$ at 10 pieces, $18.00 at 20 pieces or more.
The exact format is used for the percentage-based rules:
"quantity:discount,quantity:discount"

Please note that you must use a dot as a decimal separator because a comma separates the pricing rules.

You can change the rules separator (in case you use a comma as a decimal separator) using the "tiered_pricing_table/rules_separator" hook.

For example, the following code will change the separator to "&":

add_filter('tiered_pricing_table/rules_separator', function(){
   return '&'
});

= Can I show the pricing table/pricing blocks/pricing options using a shortcode? =

The plugin includes the [tiered-pricing-table] shortcode that can be customized with various attributes.

= Can I show the pricing table/pricing blocks/pricing options via Elementor? =

Yes! Look for the "Tiered Pricing Table" widget.

= Can I show the pricing table/pricing blocks/pricing options via Gutenberg block? =

Yes! Look for the "Tiered Pricing" block.

= Can I apply tiered pricing for manual (admin-made) orders? =

Yes!
Each order has the "recalculate with tiered pricing" button, which recalculates the cost according to the tiered pricing rules.
